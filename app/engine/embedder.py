embedder.py — local ONNX embedder (bge-small-en-v1.5)

WHY LOCAL INSTEAD OF AN EMBEDDING API:
  OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 costs $0.0001 per 1K tokens and requires
  a network round trip (~100ms). At 10,000 queries/day that's $0.50/day = $182/year.

  bge-small-en-v1.5 with ONNX Runtime runs entirely on your own CPU.
  Cost: $0.00 forever. Latency: ~25ms (4x faster, no network hop).

WHAT ONNX ACTUALLY DOES:
  The model is normally a PyTorch graph. ONNX Runtime converts it into an
  optimized, statically-compiled inference graph — similar to how a JIT
  compiler speeds up code. `export=True` does this conversion once and
  caches the result; every subsequent load is fast.

WHY A QUERY PREFIX:
  BGE models were trained with an asymmetric setup: queries get a special
  instruction prefix, documents don't. This measurably improves retrieval
  quality — skip it and you lose a few points of accuracy for free.
