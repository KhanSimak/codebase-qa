vectordb.py — Qdrant client wrapper

Qdrant is a vector database written in Rust. We use ONE collection for
all repos and filter by repo_id at query time, rather than creating a
separate collection per repo. This scales better — Qdrant collections
have fixed overhead, and pre-filtering by a payload field before the
ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) scan is fast and well-supported.
