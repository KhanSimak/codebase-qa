incremental.py — re-ingest only what changed since last time

THE PROBLEM:
  A full re-ingest of a 1,000-file repo means re-cloning, re-chunking,
  re-embedding, and re-upserting EVERYTHING, even if you only changed
  3 files. For a repo with a few thousand chunks, that's tens of seconds
  of ONNX embedding work for a change that touched almost nothing.

THE FIX, TWO LAYERS OF "DID THIS ACTUALLY CHANGE":
  Layer 1 — git diff: which FILES changed between the last ingested
            commit and HEAD? Only re-chunk those files, not the whole repo.
  Layer 2 — content hash: even within a changed file, did THIS SPECIFIC
            function's body actually change? CodeChunk.content_hash()
            (models/chunk.py) is an MD5 of the raw source. We compare the
            new chunk's hash against what's already stored in Qdrant for
            that chunk ID. If unchanged (e.g. you only edited a comment
            elsewhere in the file, or another function in the same file),
            we skip re-embedding it — the OLD vector is still perfectly
            valid, because nothing about the function's content changed.

WHAT THIS DOESN'T HANDLE (be honest about the limits):
  - Renamed/moved functions are treated as delete-old + add-new, not as
    a rename. That's fine for retrieval quality, just not maximally efficient.
  - Call graph rebuild re-walks the WHOLE repo's chunks after any change,
    because a single changed function can alter `called_by` edges anywhere
    (e.g. delete a function and everyone who called it needs that edge
    removed). This rebuild is cheap (in-memory, no embedding involved) so
    it isn't a performance concern — just worth knowing it isn't
    "incremental" in the same sense the embedding step is.
