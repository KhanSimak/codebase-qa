"""
runner.py — runs the golden dataset through retrieval and scores it

IMPORTANT SCOPE NOTE: this benchmarks RETRIEVAL quality (does the right
chunk show up, and at what rank), not the final LLM-generated answer's
correctness. Evaluating generated text quality is a much harder, fuzzier
problem (you'd need an LLM-as-judge or human review). Recall@K and MRR on
retrieval are objective, fast to compute, and directly measure the part
of the pipeline that's actually under our control — if the right chunk
never reaches the LLM, no amount of prompt engineering fixes the answer.

For speed and cost, the benchmark calls embed + hybrid retrieval directly
(skipping HyDE rewriting, reranking, and the final LLM call) — this
isolates "can hybrid search alone find the answer" which is the metric
you want to track for regressions in chunking/embedding/indexing.
