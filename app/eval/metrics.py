metrics.py — Recall@K, MRR, latency percentiles

RECALL@K:
  "Does the correct chunk appear ANYWHERE in the top K results?"
  A simple yes/no per question, averaged across the whole dataset.
  Recall@5 = 0.847 means: for 84.7% of questions, the right chunk was
  somewhere in the top 5. It says nothing about WHERE in the top 5 —
  rank 1 and rank 5 count equally. That's what MRR is for.

MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank):
  For each question, score = 1/rank of the correct chunk (0 if not found
  in the searched results at all). Average across all questions.
  MRR rewards the correct answer appearing EARLY, not just somewhere.
  A system that always puts the right chunk at rank 1 scores MRR=1.0.
  A system that always puts it at rank 5 scores MRR=0.2 — same Recall@5
  as the first system if both always include it in top 5, but MRR
  correctly shows the first system is actually better for the user.

LATENCY PERCENTILES (P50/P95/P99), NOT JUST AVERAGE:
  Averages hide tail behavior. If 95 requests take 200ms and 5 requests
  take 5000ms (a cache miss combined with a cold model, say), the AVERAGE
  looks like ~440ms — fine. But P95 correctly reports "5% of your users
  wait 5 SECONDS," which is the number that actually matters for user
  experience and for catching regressions before they compound.
